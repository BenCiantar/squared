                    <h4 id="about-name">Tony Stark - Creator of Squared</h4>
                    <p>In 2010, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to 
                        demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded 
                        and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into 
                        Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.</p>

                    <p>Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet 
                        and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the 
                        suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' 
                        weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his 
                        company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his 
                        improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor.</p>
                        
                    <p>Stark learns that Obadiah Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a coup to replace him 
                        as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark 
                        at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. 
                        Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, 
                        Stark publicly admits to being "Iron Man."</p>
